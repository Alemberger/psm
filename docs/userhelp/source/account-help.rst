Making and Changing Your Account on the Provider Screening Module site
=============================================

How do I register for an account on the PSM website?
----------------------------------------------

There are two ways to register.

If you're a Healthcare Provider:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the main page and click the "Register New Account" link. The site
will help you create an account that can submit enrollment applications
for individual or organizational healthcare providers.

For a new account, enter a username, first and last name, and an email
address. The site will create a random password and email it to you.

Your account can also have a middle name (this is optional).

There are no limits on the number or type of characters in the user's
first name, last name, username or password.

You will need to `have JavaScript turned on in your
browser <https://www.enable-javascript.com/>`__.

If you are not a healthcare provider:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an account to be a "service agent" (someone who helps get
providers enrolled) or a "service admin" (a state employee who approves
and rejects enrollments). Contact the state Medicaid office for an
account.

How do I log in?
----------------

Go to the Home page of the PSM, enter your username and password, and
click the "Login" button.

I forgot my password. Can I retrieve or reset it?
-------------------------------------------------

On the Home page of the PSM, click the "Forgot Password?" link and enter
your username and email address. Click the "Reset Password" button. The
website will email you a new password to use to log in.

information and a new password.

Profile" and click the "Change Password" link.

Can I delete my account?
------------------------

Accounts currently cannot be deleted. `A future version of the PSM may
make this
possible. <https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/327>`__
