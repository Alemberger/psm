Why do we have this enrollment process?
=======================================

Under Medicaid and similar programs, federal and state governments pay
doctors, pharmacists, and other medical service providers for treating
patients. State and federal regulations require providers to meet
eligibility standards. The enrollment process is where we verify that
eligibility. The Provider Screening Module helps states manage the
enrollment process so that eligible providers can serve Medicaid
clients.

The goal of the PSM is to make it as painless as possible for providers
to enroll (encouraging enrollment and thus improving service to Medicaid
patients), and as painless as possible for administrators to manage
enrollments.
