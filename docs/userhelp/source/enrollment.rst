Enrollment
==========

This help section explains what an enrollment is, tells you what you
need to do to create one and submit it, and answers common questions
about confusing terms.

What information do I need to create an enrollment?
---------------------------------------------------

First, you'll need to register for an account (see "how do I register
for an account on this site?"). Then you'll need to click the button to
create a new enrollment.

An enrollment includes:

-  provider/organization information, such as provider type, name, NPI,
   and contact information

-  license and certification information, including a scan of the
   license or certification itself

-  contact and billing/reimbursement addresses for the practice

-  answers to questions about the provider's past exclusions, penalties,
   terminations, and convictions, if any

-  information about ownership and potential conflicts (e.g. ownership
   over other entities billing Medicaid)

-  an electronic signature and date attesting to the accuracy of the
   enrollment information

What are the steps in the enrollment process?
---------------------------------------------

-  A provider, service agent, or service admin creates and submits a new
   enrollment for a particular provider. (A user can save a draft
   enrollment and come back later to finish and submit it.)

-  A service admin reviews the enrollment, using links provided by the
   PSM to verify enrollment details, and decides whether to approve or
   reject the submission.

-  After an enrollment has been approved, a service admin can select and
   renew it.

Who can view enrollments?
-------------------------

A provider can view their own enrollments (including draft, rejected,
approved, and pending enrollments).

A service agent or service admin can view all enrollments (including
draft, rejected, approved, and pending enrollments).

A system admin should not be able to view any enrollments. `The PSM
currently allows a system admin to view enrollments, but will remove
that capability in a future
version. <https://github.com/OpenTechStrategies/psm/issues/10>`__

Which enrollment information can a provider, service agent, or service admin modify or delete?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A provider can modify a draft enrollment, but can't delete it. A
provider also cannot delete or modify an enrollment after submitting it
(once it is "pending", "approved", or "denied").

A service agent or service admin can modify a draft or pending
enrollment, but cannot delete any enrollments.

What will a provider see or receive when enrollment is pending, modified, approved, or rejected?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you log into the PSM, you'll see any enrollments you've submitted
or started drafting via your PSM user account. You'll be able to see the
status of each enrollment.

Right now, a provider does not receive any email notifications about
their enrollment. (A future version of the PSM will send email
notifications to providers when the status of your enrollment changes.)

Can I create an enrollment for someone else?
--------------------------------------------

A service agent or a service admin can create an enrollment for someone
else.

Can I start an enrollment now and finish it later, or do I have to start and submit it all in one session?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This site lets you save a "draft" at any point while you are creating a
new enrollment. Click the "Save as draft" button. Even if you log out
and then log back in, that draft enrollment will still be available for
you to work on -- you will see it in your Dashboard and in the Draft tab
under Enrollments.

Can I start a draft enrollment and then have someone else finish it for me?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Service agents and service admins can do this, but providers cannot.

How do we renew an enrollment or update an enrollment?
------------------------------------------------------

Right now that's not something the PSM can do, but it'll be possible in
a future version.

I've already submitted an enrollment and it's pending, but I need to change something; what can I do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll need to directly contact the state Medicaid office; once you've
submitted an enrollment, you can't update it in the PSM.

How will I find out when my enrollment is accepted or rejected?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Right now, this site does not notify you via email or paper mail when
the state accepts or rejects an enrollment you have submitted. This will
change in a future version of the Provider Screening Module.

When you log into the PSM, you'll see any enrollments you've submitted
or started drafting via your PSM user account. You'll be able to see the
status of each enrollment. We recommend you log in and check regularly
for status updates.

It is your responsibility to check this regularly.

What can I do to reduce the risk of delay or rejection for an enrollment?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should: \* Include clear, accurate scans of your
licenses/certifications \* Make sure your NPI number, address, and other
details in the application are correct \* Check the `NPPES (National
Plan and Provider Enumeration System)
website <https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/>`__ to ensure your NPI status is
active \* Check the state Medicaid provider guidelines

What is the difference between a private practice and a group practice?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On the "Practice Info" page of the enrollment process for individual
providers, the site asks you:

    Do you maintain your own private practice?

If you have an Entity Type 1 (Individual) NPI number, say "yes". `The
Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services website has more guidance on
your NPI
number. <https://questions.cms.gov/faq.php?id=5005&rtopic=1851&rsubtopic=8605>`__

    Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group
    practice?

If you are employed and/or independently contracted by an organization
health care provider that has an Entity Type 2 (Organization) NPI
number, say "yes". `The CMS website has more information on Type 2 NPI
numbers and what kinds of business structures should have
them <https://questions.cms.gov/faq.php?id=5005&faqId=1965>`__.

Can I create multiple enrollments for one person (e.g., if a person is licensed as two or more kinds of provider)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes.

Why would a provider have multiple enrollments?
-----------------------------------------------

An individual person might be licensed as two or more kinds of provider.

How do I input an enrollment for an individual provider who is affiliated with multiple organizations (e.g., a psychologist who works for two clinics)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can choose to "Add Another Practice Location" on the "Practice Info"
screen of the enrollment application. This is a way to indicate that a
provider works with multiple group practices.

How do I input an enrollment for an organization with several individual providers (e.g., a clinic employing several physicians)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose the correct organizational provider type during the first step of
enrollment. On the member entry screen, click the link to add an
additional member. Repeat as necessary to add all the individuals who
will provide services under the umbrella of the organization.

When an organizational provider owns a number of separately located facilities in the state, does each facility need to enroll separately?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the organizational provider (often a corporation) owns multiple
locations, each one must be enrolled separately.

What do I do if none of the provider types seem to describe what I do (what this provider does)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact your state Medicaid office directly.

How can I update an existing organizational enrollment to add a new provider (e.g., if a clinic hires a new physician)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an enrollment is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft enrollment and edit the member list.

If you have already submitted the enrollment, then you should have the
individual, or a service agent, create a new enrollment for an
individual provider. On the "Practice Info" screen, the user should say
"Yes" to the question "Are you employed and/or independently contracted
by a group practice?" and enter the organization's information.

How can I update an existing organizational enrollment to remove a provider (e.g., if a physician retires from a clinic)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an enrollment is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft enrollment and edit the member list. If you
have already submitted the enrollment, then it is not possible to remove
an individual member via the PSM, and you will need to directly contact
your state Medicaid office.

How do I view license/certification files?
------------------------------------------

When viewing a pending enrollment, on the "Review Enrollment" screen,
look under the "License Information" heading. Next to a license or
certification number (issued by the licensure or certification
authority), you'll see a "View" link. Click that to access the scanned
image of the provider's license or certification. Your PC will probably
automatically open a program to view the file, such as:

-  PDF files: Adobe Acrobat
-  PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF and TIF files: built-in image viewer
-  DOC and DOCX files: Microsoft Word
-  PPT and PPTX files: Microsoft PowerPoint

What if I know from past experience that someone else with the same name, address, or NPI has previously been excluded from Medicaid and that automatic checks are likely to flag this enrollment as a result?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contact your state Medicaid office directly.

How do I end (terminate) my own active enrollment?
--------------------------------------------------

Currently the PSM does not give you a way to terminate an approved
enrollment, but a future version of the PSM will. Please contact the
state Medicaid office directly to terminate an enrollment.
