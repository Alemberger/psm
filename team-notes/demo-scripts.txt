   Scripts for live demonstrations of the PSM to various audiences.
   ================================================================

* For initial demos to states (based on master at ad7e051).

  1. Sign in as a provider "provider1"
    - Create New Enrollment
    - Scroll through provider types to show individual vs. organizational providers
    - Choose "Audiologist" (this is a simple type without special requirements)
    - Use NPI 0000000006
    - Try a DOB in the future and show the error shows up when you click "next" (but not immediately on tabbing away from the field)
      # Karl asks: We should talk about how we plan to add immediate validation,
      #            so that the user is made aware of such errors as soon as they
      #            indicate the field is complete (e.g., by tabbing or clicking
      #            away from the field).  However, I went looking for an issue
      #            about this, and we don't seem to have any filed?  At least,
      #            I didn't see it when I searched for "validation" or "validate"
      #            or "validity" in the issue tracker.  Do we agree that this is
      #            on the roadmap (even if not for MVP), and that it's something
      #            we can talk about?
      - See the "provider must be at least 18yo error, too! (for fun)
    - Show that the "next" doesn't work if required fields are missing (e.g. SSN)
    - Contact info "same as above" saves time
    - Indian reservation question is MN-specific, but we can ask similar questions for other states
      # Karl asks: That's hardcoded in right now, right?  Making it
      #            configurable on a per-state basis would be a rules
      #            (Drools) change, not a workflow change, I assume? 
    - Show that the license type dropdown is limited to those that match this provider type
      - Choose "Audiologist License"
      - Browse to a file that you feel okay about sharing on the sandbox /
        showing to the audience. :) (NOTE: we're not validating the file
        type yet)
      - I usually do 01/01/2015 - 12/31/2018
      - The issuing state must be Minnesota for now (NOTE: talk about
        state-specific rules, and how those will be editable -- e.g.,
        maybe you accept licenses from your state and neighboring states)
    - Private practice? Yes
      - Show that the fields change based on the answer to this question
    - Employed by group? No
      - Additional practice locations show up if you click "Yes"
    - Point out "Practice Lookup" button (click, it works)
      - We don't have data in here yet, but later providers will be able
        to find their practice
    - Fill in form:
      - Test Audiologist, 01/01/2017, 1300 S State St, Minneapolis, MN, 55404, Hennepin
      - Billing address SAME
      - Leave non-required fields blank, for time
      - 06/30 and Patient Account
    - Review form, show print button, save as draft, ability to go back and edit
    - Disclosure: no to all, sign, date, "Submit Enrollment"
  
    - Great!  Can see the enrollment on the dashboard, under "Pending."
      Risk level depends on provider type -- Audiologists are limited
      risk.  Now that it's been submitted they can't edit it anymore.
  
  Now we're ready for the admin side:
  
  2. Sign out and sign back in as a state reviewer, "admin"
     - Navigate to "Enrollments" tab, then "Pending" subtab
     - Look at available "Actions"
     - Export downloads it as a PDF, COS is "Categories of Service" (not
       fully implemented/work in progress), Edit and Print are what it
       says on the tin
     - Review is what we're interested in.
     - Click "Review"
     - Not very interesting yet, because we're not hooked up to these
       external services, but soon we'll be checking these boxes
       automatically.  For now, you could do the manual checks you're used
       to.
       - Later, other sources can be added to this list
     - Can click "View" and see the actual uploaded license
     - View Log is an audit log -- we haven't done any external screening,
       because we're not attached to those external sources yet
     - "Reject" and the enrollment will show up in the "Denied" tab.  We
       no longer have the ability to re-review
     - "Approve" ...claims to work, but the enrollment does not reliably
       show up in the "Approved" tab.  Not sure what's going on with that,
       but best not to draw attention to it.
  
  Those are the two main workflows we have, with different options for
  different provider types, etc.  We also have admin roles to create new
  users, etc. Comments/questions?

* For MESC 2017  (exact revision still TBD as of 2 Aug 2017)

  Use demo.psm.solutionguidance.com.
  
  This demo assumes that much of the provider information has already
  been filled in -- that is, that we're re-opening an application in
  progress and continuing it.  This is to save time during the demo.

  1. Show an organizational provider enrollment:
     - Choose "Durable Medical Equipment"
     - Effective Date must be within past 12 months
     - Employer ID doesn't seem to be checked
       # Karl asks: What does the above comment mean, in terms
       #            of what's happening in the demo?  Does the 
       #            demo-er do something b/c of it?
     - "Ownership Info" (something that a couple states have asked about)
       - Note that you can add multiple individual owners
       - And also multiple business owners
  
     - Back on the dashboard, note that DME is automatically flagged as
       "High" risk (based on provider type)
  
  2. Show an individual provider enrollment with multiple locations:
     - Choose "Audiologist"
     - Practice Info:
       - For "Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group
         practice?" choose Yes
         - At bottom of page, click "Add Another Practice Location"
           - Group NPI can be the same as the initial Provider NPI, and we
             can use the same NPI for multiple locations
  
  3. Admin flow:
     - Navigate to "Enrollments" tab, then "Pending" subtab
     - Look at available "Actions"
     - Export downloads it as a PDF, COS is "Categories of Service" (not
       fully implemented/work in progress), Edit and Print are what it
       says on the tin
       # Karl asks: Shall we have a printed-out copy physically there with
       #            us so we can wave it and show that printing is A Thing?
       #            That's more effective than clicking to show an on-screen
       #            PDF rendering or whatever it would be.
     - Review is what we're interested in.
     - Click "Review"
     - Not very interesting yet, because we're not hooked up to these
       external services, but soon we'll be checking these boxes
       automatically.  For now, you could do the manual checks you're used
       to.
       # Karl asks: Hmm, the above has just changed, with Jason's news
       #            https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/psm-dev/h1lAHrUMkU4
       #            right?  That should definitely become part of the demo; 
       #            it's something everyone who's expressed interest in the PSM
       #            has been focused on.
       - Later, other sources can be added to this list
     - Can click "View" and see the actual uploaded license
       # Karl asks: Maybe have printout of that with us too, for an
       #            amusing physical-world-vs-screen-world comparison.
     - View Log is an audit log -- we haven't done any external screening,
       because we're not attached to those external sources yet
       # Karl asks: Again, re Jason's post: we are attached now, right?
       #            But, do we have an audit log?  Can we?
     - "Reject" and the enrollment will show up in the "Denied" tab.  We
       no longer have the ability to re-review
     - "Approve" the DME enrollment and it will show up in the "Approved"
       tab (after a "request has been sent" message)
       # Karl asks: So we're going to choose "Approve" in the demo?
