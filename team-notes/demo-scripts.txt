   Scripts for live demonstrations of the PSM to various audiences.
   ================================================================

* For MESC 2017  (exact revision still TBD as of 2 Aug 2017)

  Use demo.psm.solutionguidance.com.
  
  This demo assumes that much of the provider information has already
  been filled in -- that is, that we're re-opening an application in
  progress and continuing it.  This is to save time during the demo.

  1. Show an organizational provider enrollment:
     - Choose "Durable Medical Equipment"
     - Effective Date must be within past 12 months
     - Employer ID doesn't seem to be checked
       # Karl asks: What does the above comment mean, in terms
       #            of what's happening in the demo?  Does the 
       #            demo-er do something b/c of it?
       # CMD: No, it's a note to the person running the demo that they
       # don't need to have a valid Employer ID, as they need a valid NPI. 
     - "Ownership Info" (something that a couple states have asked about)
       - Note that you can add multiple individual owners
       - And also multiple business owners
  
     - Back on the dashboard, note that DME is automatically flagged as
       "High" risk (based on provider type)
  
  2. Show an individual provider enrollment with multiple locations:
     - Choose "Audiologist"
     - Try a DOB in the future and show the error shows up when you
       click "next" (but not immediately on tabbing away from the field) 
      - See the "provider must be at least 18yo error, too! (for fun)
     - Practice Info:
       - Indian reservation question is MN-specific, but we can ask
         similar questions for other states 
       # Karl asks: That's hardcoded in right now, right?  Making it
       #            configurable on a per-state basis would be a rules
       #            (Drools) change, not a workflow change, I assume? 
       - For "Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group
         practice?" choose Yes
         - At bottom of page, click "Add Another Practice Location"
           - Group NPI can be the same as the initial Provider NPI, and we
             can use the same NPI for multiple locations
  
  3. Admin flow:
     - Navigate to "Enrollments" tab, then "Pending" subtab
     - Look at available "Actions"
     - Export downloads it as a PDF, COS is "Categories of Service" (not
       fully implemented/work in progress), Edit and Print are what it
       says on the tin
       # Karl asks: Shall we have a printed-out copy physically there with
       #            us so we can wave it and show that printing is A Thing?
       #            That's more effective than clicking to show an on-screen
       #            PDF rendering or whatever it would be.
     - Review is what we're interested in.
     - Click "Review"
     - Excluded provider version:
       - One pre-filled enrollment will be for a person in the LEIE
       - Review that enrollment and click "View Log"
       - View Log is an audit log -- we haven't done any external screening,
         because we're not attached to those external sources yet, but
         it will show results when we are.
       # Karl asks: Again, re Jason's post: we are attached now, right?
       #            But, do we have an audit log?  Can we?
       # CMD: The audit log is what's shown in Jason's screenshot (!).
       # We will show it once it's ready.
       - "Reject" and the enrollment will show up in the "Denied" tab.  We
         no longer have the ability to re-review

     - Non-excluded provider version:
       - Still working on linking up to these external services, but soon
         we'll be checking these boxes automatically.  For now, you could
         do the manual checks you're used to.
       - Will be able to look at "View Log" for LEIE (TBD)
       - Later, other sources can be added to this list
       - Can click "View" and see the actual uploaded license
         # Karl asks: Maybe have printout of that with us too, for an
         #            amusing physical-world-vs-screen-world comparison.
       - "Approve" the DME enrollment and it will show up in the "Approved"
         tab (after a "request has been sent" message)
