   Scripts for live demonstrations of the PSM to various audiences.
   ================================================================

* For state call [2018-03-08 Thu]
  - Kate from LA DOH

  - As always, I need to remind you all that this software is in
    progress and we know it has bugs.  I hope not to find any in this
    demo, but if we do try not to be too alarmed. :)


  - Log in as "provider1"
  - Discuss the dashboard
    - Our test provider is fairly unusual, in that they have submitted
      many different applications with different NPIs.  This is unlikely
      to happen in real life, but makes them useful for our purposes.
    - Can see "status" of different applications
    - Risk level is assigned after they're submitted, based on the
      provider type of the application
      - Later we expect to do more sophisticated risk scoring, based on
        history of fraud, etc.  Right now this is based on CMS' risk
        levels for different provider types.  As you know, risk score
        has implications for the level of screening that an applicant
        needs to go through.

  - Some of the a11y (section 508) changes that are visible to us are
    the changes to contrast in the menu headers

  - Enrollments tab
    - See the status of different applications as they move through the process
  - Nurse Practitioner enrollment (1234567893)
    - Take us back through the forms to the beginning
    - This is an individual provider type, so the forms are relatively
      simple
      - name, NPI, etc
      - Change DOB to be 2005 and see the error
      - Can upload license file
    - Note practice lookup / connection to another practice
    - At the end of the form, attest that they haven't broken any laws,
      sign electronically, and submit (but I'm not actually going to do
      that)
  - DME (1111111112)
    - Jump straight to organizational information page
    - I wanted to show an application for an entity with multiple owners
      because I know this is sometimes an area of concern for states
    - Note that you can enter multiple individual and organizational
      owners, managers, and subcontractors
    - I'm not going to click through it all, but there are similar
      summary and signing pages for this version of the application

  - Pause for questions before I move on to the state reviewer side of
    the application.

  - As admin
    - So now we're a person on the state side, looking at the entered
      applications in order to review them
    - Again we have a dashboard
    - You can see the two draft enrollments that we just worked on:
      nurse practitioner and durable medical equipment
    - Point out the search (still in progress)
    - Navigate to "enrollments"
      - draft might be useful in case someone calls in and says they're
        confused, you can look at their form and help them see what's
        going wrong
      - Pending
        - Cecilia Test -- review
        - Talk through the errors at the top of the screen
          - 
        - Click through to LEIE result
          - This is really cool!  What we're doing here is pulling in
            the LEIE and automatically looking for this provider in the
            list of excluded providers based on their NPI.  In the
            future we expect to do more sophisticated searching and
            pattern-matching, but for now we can check whether a given
            NPI has been excluded without needing a person to manually
            look.  This is the goal for all of these federal databases.

        - Possibly show the license by showing in folder?  (Maybe not,
          because it might be wonky with the screenshare)
          - 

* For MESC 2017  (`wip-leie` branch as of 7 August 2017)

  Use demo.psm.solutionguidance.com or a local copy.

  For this demo, you should have a copy of the LEIE API running at
  localhost:5000 (that is, on the same box that is running the PSM on
  port 8080).  The demo copy of the PSM should have the following users:
  
  - excluded1 (an excluded provider)
  - provider1 (a valid provider)
  - admin (a reviewer)

  - A draft DME enrollment with valid NPI
  - A draft audiologist enrollment with excluded NPI

  This demo assumes that much of the provider information has already
  been filled in -- that is, that we're re-opening an application in
  progress and continuing it.  This is to save time during the demo.  To
  insert this information, run:
  
  $ psql psm
  psm=# DROP OWNED BY ${psm_user};
  $ \i team-notes/demo-db-dbd7cf5.sql

  If you use the pre-filled data, make sure the provider statement date
  is today's date.

  # add a fake exclusion to LEIE data, to avoid demo-ing with a real
  person's name:
  
  $ sqlite3 leie.sqlite3 <<EOF
INSERT INTO exclusion(
  firstname,
  lastname,
  general,
  npi,
  dob,
  address,
  city,
  state,
  zip,
  excltype,
  excldate
) values (
  'Demo',
  'Exclusion',
  'NURSING PROFESSION',
  '1234567893',
  '1970-01-01',
  '1234 Main Street',
  'Somewhere',
  'NY',
  '12345',
  '1128b4',
  '2000-01-01'
);
EOF

  Before beginning the demo, stop and restart Wildfly to reduce the risk
  of "out of memory" errors.


* DEMO PLAN:

  1. Show an organizational provider enrollment with a valid provider:
  
     - Log in as provider1
     - DME enrollment already exists
       - "Previous page" goes one back
       - Point out multiple owners without going back further and
         entering data, to avoid the bug and save time

     - Click "Next", then submit the enrollment
  
     - Back on the dashboard, note that DME is automatically flagged as
       "High" risk (based on provider type)
  
  2. Show an individual provider enrollment with multiple locations:
     - Log in as excluded1
     - "Audiologist" enrollment exists
     - Click in then "previous" all the way back to the beginning, to show the screens
     - Has an excluded NPI: 1234567893 (this is a fake one that doesn't
       show a real provider's name) 
     - Validation tests, if there's time: try a DOB in the future and
       show the error shows up when you click "next" (but not immediately on
       tabbing away from the field)  
       - See the "provider must be at least 18yo error, too! (for fun)
     - License info
       - Indian reservation question is MN-specific, but we can ask
         similar questions for other states
       - Upload the fake license:
         docs/sample-generic-provider-license.pdf (should
         already be there)
     - Practice Info:
       - For "Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group
         practice?" choose Yes
         - At bottom of page, click "Add Another Practice Location"
           - Group NPI can be the same as the initial Provider NPI, and we
             can use the same NPI for multiple locations

      - Submit the enrollment

      - Back on the dashboard, note that Audiologists are "Limited" risk
        (the lowest possible level).  This is true even though we happen
        to know that the NPI we used is one that is excluded -- risk
        levels right now are *only* based on provider type.

  3. Admin flow:
     - Login as "admin"
     - Navigate to "Enrollments" tab, then "Pending" subtab
     - Look at available "Actions"
     - Export downloads it as a PDF, COS is "Categories of Service" (not
       fully implemented/work in progress), Edit and Print are what it
       says on the tin
     - Review is what we're interested in.
     - Click "Review" on the Audiologist enrollment
       - We see that most of these have not been checked
       - Note particularly "Applicant Must Not Be In the Excluded
         Providers List." in the list of errors
       - View Log for "EXCLUDED PROVIDER VERIFICATION IN OIG (checked
         means not in exclusion list)."
         - Results show up in a new tab
         - "Status: SUCCESS" -- we got a response from the LEIE
         - Results below show that we found this person in the LEIE,
           therefore he is excluded and we should reject this enrollment. 
       - Go back to original tab
         - If interested, show that we're not doing automated screening
           for other external sources (yet).
         - Can view the license file if we have time/interest
       - "Reject" and the enrollment will show up in the "Denied" tab.  We
         no longer have the ability to re-review

     - Now, the non-excluded provider version:
       - Go back to the "Pending" tab
       - Review the DME enrollment
       - Note that "EXCLUDED PROVIDER VERIFICATION IN OIG (checked means
         not in exclusion list)" is already checked -- this person is
         not in the LEIE!
         - Click "View Log" and see "Success - no records were matched."
          (i.e., we searched and didn't find anything)
       - For now, we'd manually check the other sources -- check all
         checkboxes 
       - Later, other sources can be added to this list
       - "Approve" the DME enrollment and it will show up in the "Approved"
         tab (after a "request has been sent" message)
         - Note, the "request has been sent" doesn't actually do
           anything yet -- possibly a chance for discussion about what
           it *should* do



* Notes about the demo, as background:
  - Valid provider:
     - Choose "Durable Medical Equipment"
     - NPI: 1111111112 (valid, non-excluded)
       - Perhaps note that we are searching the LEIE via NPI right now
     - Effective Date must be within past 12 months: 07/01/2017
     - "Ownership Info" (something that a couple states have asked
       about)
       - Business type: corporation
       - Note that you can add multiple individual owners of a corporation
         - The "This person/business has an ownership or control
           interest in another Medicaid disclosing entity, or an entity that
           does not participate in Medicaid but is required to disclose
           ownership and control interest because of participation in any
           Title V, XVIII, or XX programs. " is quite broken -- see #308
         - I'd suggest using it as an example of validation errors, then
           unchecking it to continue
