   Scripts for live demonstrations of the PSM to various audiences.
   ================================================================

If you use Emacs org mode, this file will be easier to read.

* Update to demo site in June 2018
The audience for this section is mostly @jvasile, or others who are
familiar with how the PSM has developed over time.

** provider side
   This still looks similar to previous versions, and can follow earlier
   scripts.

** admin side
   This looks different, and we should show more information.

*** Review workflow (Enrollments tab)
    - When you choose to "review" an application, you'll see that only
      the external sources that are hooked up appear.  You can mention
      that the others are coming soon.  This means that fewer
      distracting errors will appear, and fewer boxes will need to be
      checked.
    - Click on the "PASS," "FAIL," or "ERROR" in the Automatic Screening
      column to see a more comprehensible results page.

*** Reports tab
    - See the list of initial reports -- note that more can be added,
      and we expect to update and improve these.
    - "Applications by Reviewer"
      - only shows the applications that have been either Approved or
        Denied -- doesn't show pending or drafts
    - "Draft Applications"
      - shows number of drafts over time (currently the "Submitted Date"
        column should be removed)
    - "Time to Review"
      - the most-requested report -- shows how long it takes an
        application to go through the process.  Ideally this would show
        that the state is moving providers from submission to review in
        decreasing or stable amounts of time.
    - "Provider Types"
      - number of applications by provider type, over time
    - "Reviewed Documents"
      - number of documents (licenses) reviewed over time
    - "Risk Levels"
      - number of applications reviewed in each risk level over time

*** Screenings tab
    *Warning*: Most of this page is not yet wired up!  Expect buttons not
    to be functional, and set that expectation with audiences.
    - It shows the screening tests we've run on applications so far,
      either as part of the regular submission process or as regular
      re-screening over time

* For MESC 2017  (`wip-leie` branch as of 7 August 2017)

  Use demo.psm.solutionguidance.com or a local copy.

  For this demo, you should have a copy of the LEIE API running at
  localhost:5000 (that is, on the same box that is running the PSM on
  port 8080).  The demo copy of the PSM should have the following users:
  
  - excluded1 (an excluded provider)
  - provider1 (a valid provider)
  - admin (a reviewer)

  - A draft DME enrollment with valid NPI
  - A draft audiologist enrollment with excluded NPI

  This demo assumes that much of the provider information has already
  been filled in -- that is, that we're re-opening an application in
  progress and continuing it.  This is to save time during the demo.  To
  insert this information, run:
  
  $ psql psm
  psm=# DROP OWNED BY ${psm_user};
  $ \i team-notes/demo-db-dbd7cf5.sql

  If you use the pre-filled data, make sure the provider statement date
  is today's date.

  # add a fake exclusion to LEIE data, to avoid demo-ing with a real
  person's name:
  
  $ sqlite3 leie.sqlite3 <<EOF
INSERT INTO exclusion(
  firstname,
  lastname,
  general,
  npi,
  dob,
  address,
  city,
  state,
  zip,
  excltype,
  excldate
) values (
  'Demo',
  'Exclusion',
  'NURSING PROFESSION',
  '1234567893',
  '1970-01-01',
  '1234 Main Street',
  'Somewhere',
  'NY',
  '12345',
  '1128b4',
  '2000-01-01'
);
EOF

  Before beginning the demo, stop and restart Wildfly to reduce the risk
  of "out of memory" errors.


* DEMO PLAN:

  1. Show an organizational provider enrollment with a valid provider:
  
     - Log in as provider1
     - DME enrollment already exists
       - "Previous page" goes one back
       - Point out multiple owners without going back further and
         entering data, to avoid the bug and save time

     - Click "Next", then submit the enrollment
  
     - Back on the dashboard, note that DME is automatically flagged as
       "High" risk (based on provider type)
  
  2. Show an individual provider enrollment with multiple locations:
     - Log in as excluded1
     - "Audiologist" enrollment exists
     - Click in then "previous" all the way back to the beginning, to show the screens
     - Has an excluded NPI: 1234567893 (this is a fake one that doesn't
       show a real provider's name) 
     - Validation tests, if there's time: try a DOB in the future and
       show the error shows up when you click "next" (but not immediately on
       tabbing away from the field)  
       - See the "provider must be at least 18yo error, too! (for fun)
     - License info
       - Indian reservation question is MN-specific, but we can ask
         similar questions for other states
       - Upload the fake license:
         docs/sample-generic-provider-license.pdf (should
         already be there)
     - Practice Info:
       - For "Are you employed and/or independently contracted by a group
         practice?" choose Yes
         - At bottom of page, click "Add Another Practice Location"
           - Group NPI can be the same as the initial Provider NPI, and we
             can use the same NPI for multiple locations

      - Submit the enrollment

      - Back on the dashboard, note that Audiologists are "Limited" risk
        (the lowest possible level).  This is true even though we happen
        to know that the NPI we used is one that is excluded -- risk
        levels right now are *only* based on provider type.

  3. Admin flow:
     - Login as "admin"
     - Navigate to "Enrollments" tab, then "Pending" subtab
     - Look at available "Actions"
     - Export downloads it as a PDF, COS is "Categories of Service" (not
       fully implemented/work in progress), Edit and Print are what it
       says on the tin
     - Review is what we're interested in.
     - Click "Review" on the Audiologist enrollment
       - We see that most of these have not been checked
       - Note particularly "Applicant Must Not Be In the Excluded
         Providers List." in the list of errors
       - View Log for "EXCLUDED PROVIDER VERIFICATION IN OIG (checked
         means not in exclusion list)."
         - Results show up in a new tab
         - "Status: SUCCESS" -- we got a response from the LEIE
         - Results below show that we found this person in the LEIE,
           therefore he is excluded and we should reject this enrollment. 
       - Go back to original tab
         - If interested, show that we're not doing automated screening
           for other external sources (yet).
         - Can view the license file if we have time/interest
       - "Reject" and the enrollment will show up in the "Denied" tab.  We
         no longer have the ability to re-review

     - Now, the non-excluded provider version:
       - Go back to the "Pending" tab
       - Review the DME enrollment
       - Note that "EXCLUDED PROVIDER VERIFICATION IN OIG (checked means
         not in exclusion list)" is already checked -- this person is
         not in the LEIE!
         - Click "View Log" and see "Success - no records were matched."
          (i.e., we searched and didn't find anything)
       - For now, we'd manually check the other sources -- check all
         checkboxes 
       - Later, other sources can be added to this list
       - "Approve" the DME enrollment and it will show up in the "Approved"
         tab (after a "request has been sent" message)
         - Note, the "request has been sent" doesn't actually do
           anything yet -- possibly a chance for discussion about what
           it *should* do



* Notes about the demo, as background:
  - Valid provider:
     - Choose "Durable Medical Equipment"
     - NPI: 1111111112 (valid, non-excluded)
       - Perhaps note that we are searching the LEIE via NPI right now
     - Effective Date must be within past 12 months: 07/01/2017
     - "Ownership Info" (something that a couple states have asked
       about)
       - Business type: corporation
       - Note that you can add multiple individual owners of a corporation
         - The "This person/business has an ownership or control
           interest in another Medicaid disclosing entity, or an entity that
           does not participate in Medicaid but is required to disclose
           ownership and control interest because of participation in any
           Title V, XVIII, or XX programs. " is quite broken -- see #308
         - I'd suggest using it as an example of validation errors, then
           unchecking it to continue
