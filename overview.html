<h4>How Was the Provider Screening Portal Application Built</h4>
<p>
    <span>The NASA Center of Excellence for Collaborative Innovation (CoECI) through an Interagency Agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administered a crowd-sourced application development challenge for the Medicare and Medicaid Services, Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS). The challenge was to build a multi-state, multi-program provider screening application capable of risk scoring, credentialing validation, identify authentication, and sanction checks, that lowered the burden on providers and reduced administrative and infrastructure expenses for states and federal programs.</span></p>
<p>
    <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
    <span>The application was built using NASA’s contract with Harvard Business School in association with the Institute of Quantitative Social Sciences and their subcontract with </span><a href="http://www.topcoder.com">TopCoder</a><span>.  The Application Development Challenge was sponsored by CMS as part of the Partnership for Program Integrity Innovation program with the specific intent of developing an application to improve capabilities for streamlining operations and screening providers to reduce fraud and abuse.</span></p>

    <span>The result and code contained herein is the result of that challenge.  The challenge was comprised of an omnibus of 120 contests launched between June 2012 and April 2013, to cover all phases of the software devleopment life cycle.
