# Provider Screening Module Page

This is the project home page for the open source Provider Screening Module (PSM). The site is built with Jekyll and deployed on GitHub Pages at [projectpsm.org](projectpsm.org).

## Dashboard Setup

The files for the front end of the PSM project dashboard live here in the `dashboard` directory (JS, JSON, CSS, and HTML files).  The data for the dashboard is in the `features-info.json` file, which is generated by scripts in the [psm-dashboard](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm-dashboard) repo, and is checked in here whenever it is regenerated. (Previously all the dashboard files lived in the `psm-dashboard` repo.)

Unlike the other pages in this site, the dashboard page is not modified by `jekyll`. (Note that `dashboard/index.html` has no YAML frontmatter, but is a plain HTML file.)  Instead `jekyll` simply copies all the files from the `dashboard` directory to the `_site` directory. So the dashboard page will need to be updated manually when changes are made to, for example, the navigation links in the site header.

## Development

Use `$ jekyll build` to generate the static site in the `_site` directory.  Then if you just open up the generated files in your browser, there will likely be cross-origin errors and other issues. To avoid this (on Linux), run the following line in the `_site` directory to spin up a local server and view the site that way.

`$ python3 -m http.server`
