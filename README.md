# Provider Screening Module Page

This is the project home page for the open source Provider Screening Module (PSM). The site is built with Jekyll and deployed on GitHub Pages at [projectpsm.org](projectpsm.org).

## Dashboard Setup

The PSM project dashboard is developed separately in the [psm-dashboard](https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm-dashboard) repo and embedded on this site in a responsive iframe with [Pym.js](http://blog.apps.npr.org/pym.js/). The dashboard's [GitHub Pages link](https://solutionguidance.github.io/psm-dashboard/) is used because [GitHub only permits a CNAME to be used with a single project](https://help.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#cname-already-taken), and projectpsm.org is already set up on this repo as a [project site](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages-sites) rather than a [user or organization site](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#user-and-organization-pages-sites) which would apply to multiple repos for a user or organization.
