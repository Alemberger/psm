# This is the docker-compose file for the psm.  It's quite an early
# draft and is meant to get a dev/test version up.  Don't use it in
# production.  For one thing, the mail system is fake.  For another,
# no thought has been given to security (e.g. the password is always
# 'psm').  I haven't cleaned up versions either.
