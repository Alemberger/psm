<h2>Creating and Submitting an Application</h2>

<p>
  Log in with a provider account:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/login.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img src="/psm-screenshots/login.thumb.png" />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  See a table of all existing enrollment applications:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/all-enrollments.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/all-enrollments.thumb.png" />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Or view applications by a given status, like "Draft" applications. Click
  "Create New Enrollment" to start a new application:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/draft-enrollments.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/draft-enrollments.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  First, select the provider type, in this example an "Audiologist":
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/select-provider-type.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/select-provider-type.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Next, enter personal information:
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/personal-info.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/personal-info.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Then enter license information, uploading a copy of any required licenses:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/license-info.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/license-info.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Next enter practice information:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Before submitting, review the application summary:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Finally, fill out the provider statement and submit the application:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/provider-statement.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/provider-statement.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/submit-enrollment-success.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/submit-enrollment-success.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The application will now appear with a "Pending" status.  All audiologist
  providers are automatically assigned a risk level of "limited" (risk levels
  are based on provider type):
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/pending-enrollments-with-limited-risk-audiologist.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/pending-enrollments-with-limited-risk-audiologist.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Creating and submitting an application for an organization is similar, but
  involves entering organization information and ownership information.  Here
  are screenshots of these pages for a "Durable Medical Equipment" application:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/ownership-info-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/ownership-info-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/ownership-info-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/ownership-info-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<h2>
  Reviewing Applications as a Service Administrator
</h2>

<p>
  Upon logging in as a service administrator, you see a dashboard of the latest
  activity:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/dashboard.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/dashboard.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  In the "enrollments" section are tables showing enrollment applications:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/all-enrollments-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/all-enrollments-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The applications can be filtered using various criteria and/or easily viewed
  by status: "Draft", "Pending", "Approved", and "Denied". Depending on an
  application's status, in the "Actions" column there are links for viewing,
  editing, exporting (as a PDF), adding notes, and reviewing it:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/draft-enrollments-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/draft-enrollments-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/pending-enrollments-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/pending-enrollments-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/approved-enrollments-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/approved-enrollments-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/denied-enrollments-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/denied-enrollments-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking "review" for an application takes us to the application review page,
  where we can see the results of automated screenings by various external
  services.  Currently that includes the LEIE, a list of excluded providers.
  Here we are reviewing an "Audiologist" application that failed the LEIE
  screening:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/review-audiologist-leie-fail.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/review-audiologist-leie-fail.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "FAIL" result link brings up a page with more details about the
  failed screening:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/leie-result-fail-audiologist.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/leie-result-fail-audiologist.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "Reject" button on the review page rejects this "Audiologist"
  application, and it then appears with a status of "Denied" in the enrollment
  tables:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/rejected-list-with-audiologist.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/rejected-list-with-audiologist.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking "Review" for a "Durable Medical Equipment" application shows that it
  passed the LEIE screening, and the "Verified" checkbox is already checked for
  that screening:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/review-dme-pass.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/review-dme-pass.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "PASS" result link brings up a page with more details about the
  successful screening:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/leie-results-pass-dme.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/leie-results-pass-dme.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "Approve" button on the review page approves this "Durable
  Medical Equipment" application and an email is sent to notify the provider:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/dashboard-approval-request-sent-dme.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/dashboard-approval-request-sent-dme.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The application then appears as "Approved" in the enrollment tables:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/all-enrollments-with-approved-dme.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/all-enrollments-with-approved-dme.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<h2>
  Adding Notes to an Application
</h2>

<p>
  A service administrator can add notes to an application that can be read by
  the provider who submitted the application and by other service
  administrators:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/notes/write-notes.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/notes/write-notes.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/notes/view-notes.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/notes/view-notes.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<h2>
  Viewing Reports
</h2>

<p>
  The PSM produces various reports for service administrators:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reports.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reports.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  All report data can be downloaded as CSV files. The "Applications
  by Reviewer" report lists all reviewed applications and who
  reviewed them, for a given date range:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/applications-by-reviewer.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/applications-by-reviewer.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Most reports present their data in both tables and in a visual graph.
  The "Draft Applications" report shows the number of draft applications
  created over time:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/draft-applications-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/draft-applications-1.thumb.png"

      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reports.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The "Time to Review" report shows average time (mean and median)
  between application submission and its approval or denial over time:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/time-to-review-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/time-to-review-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/time-to-review-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/time-to-review-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The "Provider Types" report summarizes the number of reviewed
  applications by provider type over time:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/provider-types-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/provider-types-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/provider-types-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/provider-types-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The "Reviewed Documents" report shows the number of licenses
  and similar documents reviewed over time:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reviewed-documents-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reviewed-documents-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reviewed-documents-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/reviewed-documents-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The "Risk Levels" report shows the number of applications submitted
  at each risk level (limited, moderate, high) over time:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/risk-levels-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/risk-levels-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/risk-levels-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/reports/risk-levels-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<h2>
  Customizing the automatic re-screening schedule:
</h2>

<p>
  The PSM automatically re-screens approved applications on a monthly basis. A
  service administrator can view and edit the schedule for these automated
  re-screenings:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/functions/screening-schedules/screening-schedules-view.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/functions/screening-schedules/screening-schedules-view.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/functions/screening-schedules/screening-schedules-edit.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/functions/screening-schedules/screening-schedules-edit.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<h2>
  Creating and Editing Agreements and Addendums
</h2>

<p>
  Service administrators can view, edit, and add new agreements and addendums,
  the documents that contain legal terms and conditions that providers agree to
  when they submit an application:
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/functions/agreements-addendums/agreements-addendums-list.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/functions/agreements-addendums/agreements-addendums-list.thumb.png"
