<h2>Creating and Submitting an Application</h2>

<p>
  Log in with a provider account.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/login.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img src="/psm-screenshots/login.thumb.png" />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  See a table of all existing enrollment applications.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/all-enrollments.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/all-enrollments.thumb.png" />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Or view applications by a given status, like "Draft" applications. Click
  "Create New Enrollment" to start a new application.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/draft-enrollments.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/draft-enrollments.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  First, select the provider type, in this example an "Audiologist".
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/select-provider-type.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/select-provider-type.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Next, enter personal information.
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/personal-info.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/personal-info.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Then enter license information, uploading a copy of any required licenses.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/license-info.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/license-info.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Next enter practice information.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/practice-information-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Before submitting, review the application summary.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/summary-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Finally, fill out the provider statement and submit the application.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/provider-statement.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/provider-statement.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/submit-enrollment-success.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/submit-enrollment-success.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The application will now appear with a "Pending" status.  All audiologist
  providers are automatically assigned a risk level of "limited".  (Risk levels
  are based on provider type.)
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/pending-enrollments-with-limited-risk-audiologist.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/audiologist-application/pending-enrollments-with-limited-risk-audiologist.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Creating and submitting an application for an organization is similar, but
  involves entering organization information and ownership information.  Here
  are screenshots of these pages for a "Durable Medical Equipment" application.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"

    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-2.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/organization-info-2.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/provider/dme-application/ownership-info-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"

<h2>
  Reviewing Applications as a Service Administrator
</h2>

<p>
  Upon logging in as a service administrator, you see a dashboard of the latest
  activity.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/dashboard.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/dashboard.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  In the "enrollments" section are tables showing enrollment applications.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/all-enrollments-1.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/enrollments-tables/all-enrollments-1.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The applications can be filtered using various criteria and/or easily viewed
  by status: "Draft", "Pending", "Approved", and "Denied". Depending on an
  application's status, in the "Actions" column there are links for viewing,
  editing, exporting (as a PDF), adding notes, and reviewing it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  Clicking "review" for an application takes us to the application review page,
  where we can see the results of automated screenings by various external
  services.  Currently that includes the LEIE, a list of excluded providers.
  Here we are reviewing an "Audiologist" application that failed the LEIE
  screening.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/review-audiologist-leie-fail.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/review-audiologist-leie-fail.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "FAIL" result link brings up a page with more details about the
  failing screening.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/leie-result-fail-audiologist.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/leie-result-fail-audiologist.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "Reject" button on the review page rejects this "Audiologist"
  application, and it then appears with a status of "Denied" in the enrollment
  tables.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/rejected-list-with-audiologist.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-audiologist/rejected-list-with-audiologist.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking "Review" for a "Durable Medical Equipment" application shows that it
  passed the LEIE screening, and the "Verified" checkbox is already checked for
  that screening.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/review-dme-pass.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/review-dme-pass.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "PASS" result link brings up a page with more details about the
  successful screening.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/leie-results-pass-dme.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/leie-results-pass-dme.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Clicking the "Approve" button on the review page approves this "Durable
  Medical Equipment" application and an email is sent to notify the provider.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/dashboard-approval-request-sent-dme.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"
  >
    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/dashboard-approval-request-sent-dme.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  The application then appears as "Approved" in the enrollment tables.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/all-enrollments-with-approved-dme.png"
    class="screenshot-thumbnail"

    <img
      src="/psm-screenshots/service-admin/review-dme/all-enrollments-with-approved-dme.thumb.png"
    />
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  These screenshots illustrate some of the features and common workflows of the PSM, but
  they are not exhaustive.  Soon more screenshots will be added to this page to illustrate
  other aspects of the PSM (such as reports).
